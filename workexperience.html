            <p>On this page, you can read about my past work and internship experiences and how they have shaped me into who I am today.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Entrepreneur, Co-Founder | WRKD Clothing Inc.</h2>
            <p>In the midst of quarantine, my friend and I decided to establish our very own apparel company due to our love for clothing and small details. We created WRKD Clothing Inc. with a focus on quality and details in an attempt to "transform sloppy sleepwear into trendy streetwear." Each item we produce is locally hand-embroidered and printed to perfection in New York. One of the main skills that I have developed drastically while creating this company is my marketing analytical skills, which I use to sell and advertise products on social media platforms, including Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook. Check us our <a class="company" href="https://wrkdclothing.com/">website</a> or <a class="company" href="https://www.instagram.com/wrkdclothing/">Instagram</a>!</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Government Analyst Summer Intern | Office of Legislator Joshua A. Lafazan</h2>
            <p>Through this internship experience, I became proficient in conducting research and analyzing government documents relation to the bill creation process. In addition, I developed my public speaking and presentation skills by delivering daily presentations to large audiences on Zoom, where I addressed ways to resolve issues in Nassau County, New York, including gang violence, narcotics, disability rights, and drunk driving prevention.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Information Technology Summer Intern | SJ Associates</h2>
            <p>As an IT intern for SJ Associates, a company that specializes in the sale and distribution of technical and electronic components, I wrote Python, HTML5, and CSS code to automate the daily data migration flow from Microsoft to SQL Server efficiently. Also, I modernized their data analytics and automation processes by increasing the accuracy of and accelerating their coded procedures by 24%. In addition, I built SQL Server databases to store SJ Associates' data and expanded my analytical background by collaborating with my peers. Overall, I gained a lot of passion for learning about new technology and technical skills that can be applied in the information technology industry.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Marketing Coordinator Summer Intern | Kollectico/Long Island Media</h2>
            <p>At Kollectico and Long Island Media, I analyzed product data from sales reports using Shopify's tools and features to respond to trends and patterns in consumer purchasing. I utilized these results to produce Instagram advertisements for trending products, which resulted in increase in the site's traffic rate by 45%. In addition, I utilized UX heuristics to redesign LongIsland.com, resulting in an enhanced user engagement and site traffic rate by 21%. Lastly, I managed social media accounts and served as a customer service representative by responding to client inquiries via phone and email.</p>
